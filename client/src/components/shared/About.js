              I'm LuLu, and I'm a teacher from Washington. Over the last few
              weeks, I helped develop the MainMenu app with my helpful
              teammates. My favorite part of developing this app was working on
              the QR feature. I also focused on the add/edit/delete functions
              throughout the app. In my spare time I enjoy gardening, painting,
              and hanging out with my family and pets.

              Iâ€™m Britt, I have enjoyed the struggle of developing the MainMenu app. 
              Without the help of my support group, Skylar and Lulu none of this would have been possible.

            Helloooo my name is Skylar, Currently I am a Maintenance Director, 
            living the dream one day at a time. 
            I am in the transition of moving my life from good ol' Oregon to
            Utah, where I can become a true Web Developer! I enjoy long walks
            on the beach and laying in a field of flowers daydreaming what life
            will be like as a full time Web Dev.
